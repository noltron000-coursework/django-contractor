# Mechanical Keyboards
Mechanical Keyboards are pretty cool!
They are clicky and clacky, and can be categorized nicely.

The website will describe various keyboards, what key they use, and what year they came out.
Since every keyboard has keys, each will claim what kind of keys they use as well.
Those key-types can also be viewed in detail, with descriptions and brands.
